# Draggable2
==============================

Draggable adds drag and drop sorting to custom channel fields, member fields, statuses, and categories in the [ExpressionEngine](http://www.expressionengine.com) control panel.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Drag categories to the right to nest them below others


## Notices
- Javascript required (please report IE issues on github)
- Currently only works with default database prefix of exp_

*__Note:__ Draggable has been merged into another addon of mine, 
Facelift, which adds additional functionality to the admin interface beyond drag and drop sorting.*
=======
## Installation

To install Draggable:

1. Copy the `/draggable/` folder to your `/system/expressionengine/third_party/` folder.
2. Enable Extensions
3. Install the Draggable Accessory and Extension

Once installed, you'll be able to sort entries on the custom channel fields, member fields, statuses, and categories pages by dragging and dropping the table rows. Row order is saved automatically when you drop the row in its new position.
